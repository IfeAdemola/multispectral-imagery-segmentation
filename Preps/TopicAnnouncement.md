# Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation of Multispectral Satellite Imagery

***Created 2024-01-22***

## Introduction
Accurate land use and land cover mapping from satellite imagery, i.e. semantic segmentation of ares in the images into categories such as forests, urban areas, agricultural land and water bodies, is crucial for environmental monitoring and sustainable development.
These maps can be used for biodiversity conservation, rapid response in disaster relief, and informing urban planning decisions by detailing the expansion of urban areas and the impact of human activities on the landscape. This study shall focus on the specific Area of the Amazon rainforest, where major land surface changes reduce the biodiversity and have adverse effect on global climate.

## Short Description

This research project delves into the world of unsupervised segmentation methods, specifically tailored for the intricate domain of satellite imagery. 
ESA's Sentinel-2 mission is particularly well suited to this task, providing freely available high-resolution multispectral data of every location on the Earth's surface approximately every 5-6 days.
The data for this project will be provided as ready to be loaded NumPy arrays, with accompanying meta data and information.
The objective is to segment the land cover present in a given multispectral satellite image in an unsupervised (or weakly supervised) manner.
